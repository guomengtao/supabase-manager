## Dependencies

- [@supabase/supabase-js](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js) v2.39.3
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) v5.3.0

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/supabase-manager.git
   ```

2. Configure Supabase:
   - Create a new project on [Supabase](https://supabase.com)
   - Update `js/config.js` with your project URL and anon key
   - Create necessary storage buckets: 'images' and 'files'
   - Set up the following tables:
     ```sql
     -- Articles table
     create table articles (
       id uuid default uuid_generate_v4() primary key,
       title text not null,
       content text not null,
       created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
       updated_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
       is_deleted boolean default false,
       url text,
       tags text[]
     );
     ```

3. Deploy:
   - Push to GitHub
   - Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings
   - Set the branch to `main` and folder to `/ (root)`

## Usage

Visit the deployed application and use the navigation menu to access different features:

- **Dashboard**: View project statistics and connection details
- **Project Info**: Explore database schema and project configuration
- **Articles**: Manage your articles with tags and URLs
- **Real-time**: Monitor real-time database changes
- **Image Upload**: Upload and manage images
- **File Manager**: Handle file uploads and storage

## Security Considerations

- API keys are stored client-side (use environment variables in production)
- File type validation is implemented
- Size restrictions are in place for uploads
- Soft delete is used instead of hard delete
